# Guidelines
Guidelines for starting a production level project

# Front End Development

* Sound knowledge of javascript, both ES2015 - EC2017

* Knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3 is compulsury

* Use of CSS libraries like scss, etc .. are required for clean code 

* Use of :root & :global functionalities and css 'var' to make a general design guideline so that the code remains uniform.

* Knowledge of optimised frameworks like React, Angular, Vue js ( I mostly code on React, thus will focus on it more)
    * React - https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
    * Angular - https://angular.io/docs
    * Vue - https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/
    
* Use of React Hooks, Basically Hooks are a method by which we can convert a 'Class' based component to a 'Functional' component.
    * Hooks - https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html

* Use of Redux as it acts a global store to all of your API calls, in a way the data from the API call gets stored globally where you can   access it from any component.
    * Redux - https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/quick-start
    
* Use clients like axios or apollo-cient to make your query fetching faster and optimised, React in general has a default http request     getter called 'fetch'.

* Knowledge of bundling tools like 'webpack' is really important.

* Knowledge of web hosting is required, I would personally prefer AWS and for pipeline I use 'Jenkins', there is a bit of a learning       curve to it but you guys will get through
